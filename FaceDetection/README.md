> Sample - face-detection - is the simplest implementation of the face detection functionality on Android. It supports 2 modes of execution: available by default Java wrapper for the cascade classifier, and manually crafted JNI call to a native class which supports tracking. Even Java version is able to show close to the real-time performance on a Google Nexus One device.
